<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome.</h3>

<p>
This page currently contains a lot of resources organized over the span of a year to help you get started. Let's go over the rationale and purpose behind this training first. There are three main objectives of this course:

<ul>
  <li><strong>First,</strong> to give you very strong reading, writing and synthesis skills. At any job, no matter what, if you want to make progress, you will be expected to read new material with little familiarity. Then you have to absorb what you read, tranform it in your own words and apply it. There will be a lot of reading involved, here's something to make it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Lubes-Silicone-Hybrid-Lubricant/dp/B00SZ3O6OU/">easier</a></li>

  <li><strong>Secondly,</strong> the field of web development is moving very fast. Before you can dive into it, you need to know what's happening currently, the first month or so are designed to help you get up to speed. It's not possible to know everything, but you can learn to pick up on trends. This training won't teach you everything, but at the very least, it will teach you how to learn whatever the hell you want.</li>

  <li><strong>Lastly,</strong> to get you able to play with CMS systems, know UX and UI better, use a linux terminal proficiently, be able to read man-pages, get a sysadmin certificate and become a cool guy.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#rules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules</h3>

<p>
There are a few rules that you need to follow:

<ul>
  <li>Don't ask why something is the way it is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0">just do it.</a></li>

  <li>Don't take shortcuts while reading or writing. This is for your benefit, so the simplest way to get through it is by following the schedule. Falling behind is okay, life happens but still try to catch up fast. Initially, it will feel like your reading is too slow but really you will feel the difference in just a few weeks.</li>

  <li>To ask for help, always have specific questions, don't ask broad generalizations because those will not help you. Trust me on this, being able to pin-point exactly what you are having difficulty understanding is a very tough task, almost a skill in itself.</li>

  <li>Some of these tasks may seem insurmountable, but you can definitely do it. Don't give up and read manga for inspiration.</li>

</ul>
